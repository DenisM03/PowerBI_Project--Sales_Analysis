# **1.Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL**
Created a Sales Database to store sales data which serve as Datawarehouse.Later built a connection to Power Bi to tranform data smoothly,where Data Analysis and Visualisation are to be performed.          

I have done an Exploratory Data Analysis of the data using sql addressing various  business questions and derived insights from the sales data.    
I have attached the sql file in this repository.


# **2.ETL and Data Preprocessing**
Imported the data from Mysql database.Used power query to clean and transform the data.Filtered rows which are unrelevant and with USD currency.        
Transformed the sales by normalising the sales to Indian currency,
unit conversion from USD to INR using calculated column.
